## tictactoe - A Simple Single Player Tic Tac Toe Game using ReactJS

Making a simple game of tic-tac-toe be this tricky to beat. Well, it's all maths and a simple algorithm behind it. The AI in this project uses an algorithm which we call "minimax". Minimax is one of the
fundemental algorithms to understand Game Theory for AI bots/CPUs. The tic-tac-toe is one the most basic demonstrations of this algorithm as this game has either 3 states/scenarios; A win, a draw or a loss.
While both of the players attempt to do the best optimal move at each level, one player (e.g you) is trying to maximise it's chances of winning at each move, while the other (The CPU) is trying to minimize
your utility. At each move, the CPU generates what we call a game tree recursively, and gives a score to each possible game state possible from that particular board state. A positive score would mean that the
user is winning, a negetive score would mean that the CPU is winning, and a zero would mean that it is going towards a draw. The CPU would then backtrack towards the original position of the game again, and
will choose the move that had the negetive most value, thus decreasing the chances of the player winning at each move of the game. This algorithm is mostly applicable on board games due to it's assumption that
both players are having alternating moves and both players are trying to score the best optimal move at each level. Fascinating right?

##

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
